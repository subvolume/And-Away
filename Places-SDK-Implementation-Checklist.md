## Notes
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Don't skip phases - they depend on each other
- Test thoroughly at each step before moving forward
- Keep the existing app functionality working throughout the process
- Focus on minimalism - only add what's needed

## Phase 4 Completion Summary âœ…
**Successfully completed on:** *[Current Session]*

**Key Achievements:**
- âœ… **Unified Place Models** - Clean, consistent data structure across the app
- âœ… **GooglePlacesSwift Integration** - Modern Swift SDK properly configured  
- âœ… **Clean Architecture** - Removed old conflicting models and mock data
- âœ… **Compilation Success** - All code builds and runs without errors
- âœ… **Foundation Ready** - Solid base for Phase 5 real API implementation

**Lessons Learned:**
- Mock data maintenance becomes technical debt during model migrations
- Placeholder implementations work better than complex mock logic for verification phases
- Phase separation is critical - setup vs implementation should be distinct
- Real API exploration needs to come after structure setup, not before

## Recent SDK Updates (November 2024)
- **Google consolidated both GooglePlaces and GooglePlacesSwift into one repository**
- **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-places-sdk` (contains both SDKs)
- **Key Change:** During package installation, select `GooglePlacesSwift` library instead of `GooglePlaces`
- **Minimum Version:** 9.2.0 or later required for GooglePlacesSwift access
- **Import Statement:** Use `import GooglePlacesSwift` (not `import GooglePlaces`)
- **Initialization:** Use `PlacesClient.shared.initialize(with: apiKey)` (modern Swift API)
