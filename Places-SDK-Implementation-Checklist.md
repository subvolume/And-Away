## Phase 2: SDK Installation & Project Setup

### 2.1 Install Google SDKs

- [x] Add required import statements where needed

### 2.2 Configure API Key in App
- [x] Add API key to Config.plist or secure configuration
- [x] Initialize Google Places SDK with API key in AppDelegate/App.swift

- [x] Test basic SDK initialization (no API calls yet)

### 2.3 Update App Permissions
- [x] Verify CoreLocation permissions are properly configured
- [x] Test location permissions on device/simulator
- [x] Update privacy usage descriptions if needed

## Phase 3: Study & Extract from Google Sample App

### 3.1 Download and Study Google's Sample
- [x] Clone sample repository: `https://github.com/googlemaps-samples/ios-places-sdk-samples`
- [x] Run the sample app and explore functionality
- [x] Identify relevant code patterns for Text Search
- [x] Identify relevant code patterns for Nearby Search
- [x] Identify relevant code patterns for Place Photos

### 3.2 Extract Service Layer Patterns
- [x] Study how Google structures their service classes
- [x] Note their error handling approaches
- [x] Document their async/await patterns
- [x] Review their API configuration methods

## Phase 4: Create Custom Models & Adapters

### 4.1 Create Unified Place Model
- [x] Create `Models/PlaceModels.swift`
- [x] Define unified `Place` struct with all needed properties
- [x] Add any custom properties specific to "And Away" app
- [x] Test model compilation

### 4.2 Create Google SDK Adapters  
- [x] Create `Models/PlaceAdapters.swift`
- [x] Build `GooglePlaceAdapter` to convert Google models to our `Place` model
- [x] Add mapping functions for all Google SDK response types
- [x] Test adapter functions with sample data

### 4.3 Create Place Categorization System
- [x] Create `Models/PlaceCategorization.swift`
- [x] Define place type categories and color assignments
- [x] Create icon mappings for different place types
- [x] Implement category detection logic

### 4.4 Clean Up Old Models
- [ ] Remove `GoogleAutocompleteModels.swift`
- [ ] Remove `GoogleDirectionsModels.swift` 
- [ ] Remove `GooglePlaceDetailsModels.swift`
- [ ] Remove `GooglePlacesSearchModels.swift`
- [ ] Update `MockData.swift` to use new unified models

## Phase 5: Create Service Layer

### 5.1 Text Search Service
- [ ] Create `Services/GooglePlacesService.swift`
- [ ] Implement text search functionality ("pizza in New York")
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Test with real API calls

### 5.2 Nearby Search Service  
- [ ] Add nearby search functionality ("restaurants near me")
- [ ] Implement location-based filtering
- [ ] Add category-based search options
- [ ] Test with user location

### 5.3 Place Photos Service
- [ ] Add place photos functionality
- [ ] Implement photo loading and caching
- [ ] Add fallback for places without photos
- [ ] Test photo display

### 5.4 Distance & Travel Time
- [ ] Add distance calculation (client-side using coordinates)
- [ ] Integrate Routes API for travel time estimates
- [ ] Add multiple transportation mode support
- [ ] Test accuracy of calculations

## Phase 6: Integrate with Existing UI

### 6.1 Update Search Components
- [ ] Connect `SearchBarView` to Google Text Search
- [ ] Update `SearchResultsView` to display Google Places data
- [ ] Update `SearchEmptyStateView` with new search capabilities
- [ ] Test search functionality end-to-end

### 6.2 Replace MapKit with Google Maps
- [ ] Replace `MapKitView.swift` with Google Maps implementation
- [ ] Display Google Places results on Google Maps (required by Google TOS)
- [ ] Add place markers with proper styling
- [ ] Implement place selection from map
- [ ] Test map interactions

### 6.3 Update Place Details
- [ ] Update `PlaceDetailsView` to show Google Places data
- [ ] Add place photos display
- [ ] Add business hours, contact info, ratings
- [ ] Test place details functionality

### 6.4 Apply Existing Styling

## Notes
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Don't skip phases - they depend on each other
- Test thoroughly at each step before moving forward
- Keep the existing app functionality working throughout the process
- Focus on minimalism - only add what's needed
