# Google Places SDK Implementation Checklist

> **Note:** This document is maintained and updated by the AI assistant as we work through the implementation together. All progress, changes, and discoveries will be tracked here in real-time.

## Phase 1: Google Cloud Console Setup

### 1.1 Google Cloud Console Account Setup
- [ ] Create or log into Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com)
- [ ] Create a new project or select existing project for "And Away" app
- [ ] Set up billing account (required for Places API usage)

### 1.2 Enable Required APIs
- [ ] Enable **Places API (New)** (this covers Text Search, Nearby Search, Place Photos when using the SDK)
- [ ] Enable **Routes API** (for travel time calculations)

### 1.3 API Key Configuration
- [ ] Generate new API key in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Restrict API key to iOS bundle identifier (your app's bundle ID)
- [ ] Restrict API key to Places API (New) and Routes API
- [ ] Save API key securely (will add to app later)

### 1.4 Security & Billing Setup
- [ ] Set up usage quotas and alerts to monitor API costs
- [ ] Configure budget alerts for API spending
- [ ] Document API key securely in team password manager

## Phase 2: SDK Installation & Project Setup

### 2.1 Install Google Places Swift SDK
- [ ] Open Xcode project
- [ ] Add Swift Package Manager dependency: `https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-places-sdk`
- [ ] Verify SDK installation compiles successfully
- [ ] Add required import statements where needed

### 2.2 Configure API Key in App
- [ ] Add API key to Config.plist or secure configuration
- [ ] Initialize Google Places SDK with API key in AppDelegate/App.swift
- [ ] Test basic SDK initialization (no API calls yet)

### 2.3 Update App Permissions
- [ ] Verify CoreLocation permissions are properly configured
- [ ] Test location permissions on device/simulator
- [ ] Update privacy usage descriptions if needed

## Phase 3: Study & Extract from Google Sample App

### 3.1 Download and Study Google's Sample
- [ ] Clone sample repository: `https://github.com/googlemaps-samples/ios-places-sdk-samples`
- [ ] Run the sample app and explore functionality
- [ ] Identify relevant code patterns for Text Search
- [ ] Identify relevant code patterns for Nearby Search
- [ ] Identify relevant code patterns for Place Photos

### 3.2 Extract Service Layer Patterns
- [ ] Study how Google structures their service classes
- [ ] Note their error handling approaches
- [ ] Document their async/await patterns
- [ ] Review their API configuration methods

## Phase 4: Create Custom Models & Adapters

### 4.1 Create Unified Place Model
- [ ] Create `Models/PlaceModels.swift`
- [ ] Define unified `Place` struct with all needed properties
- [ ] Add any custom properties specific to "And Away" app
- [ ] Test model compilation

### 4.2 Create Google SDK Adapters  
- [ ] Create `Models/PlaceAdapters.swift`
- [ ] Build `GooglePlaceAdapter` to convert Google models to our `Place` model
- [ ] Add mapping functions for all Google SDK response types
- [ ] Test adapter functions with sample data

### 4.3 Create Place Categorization System
- [ ] Create `Models/PlaceCategorization.swift`
- [ ] Define place type categories and color assignments
- [ ] Create icon mappings for different place types
- [ ] Implement category detection logic

### 4.4 Clean Up Old Models
- [ ] Remove `GoogleAutocompleteModels.swift`
- [ ] Remove `GoogleDirectionsModels.swift` 
- [ ] Remove `GooglePlaceDetailsModels.swift`
- [ ] Remove `GooglePlacesSearchModels.swift`
- [ ] Update `MockData.swift` to use new unified models

## Phase 5: Create Service Layer

### 5.1 Text Search Service
- [ ] Create `Services/GooglePlacesService.swift`
- [ ] Implement text search functionality ("pizza in New York")
- [ ] Add error handling and loading states
- [ ] Test with real API calls

### 5.2 Nearby Search Service  
- [ ] Add nearby search functionality ("restaurants near me")
- [ ] Implement location-based filtering
- [ ] Add category-based search options
- [ ] Test with user location

### 5.3 Place Photos Service
- [ ] Add place photos functionality
- [ ] Implement photo loading and caching
- [ ] Add fallback for places without photos
- [ ] Test photo display

### 5.4 Distance & Travel Time
- [ ] Add distance calculation (client-side using coordinates)
- [ ] Integrate Routes API for travel time estimates
- [ ] Add multiple transportation mode support
- [ ] Test accuracy of calculations

## Phase 6: Integrate with Existing UI

### 6.1 Update Search Components
- [ ] Connect `SearchBarView` to Google Text Search
- [ ] Update `SearchResultsView` to display Google Places data
- [ ] Update `SearchEmptyStateView` with new search capabilities
- [ ] Test search functionality end-to-end

### 6.2 Update Map Integration
- [ ] Connect `MapKitView` to display Google Places results
- [ ] Add place markers with proper styling
- [ ] Implement place selection from map
- [ ] Test map interactions

### 6.3 Update Place Details
- [ ] Update `PlaceDetailsView` to show Google Places data
- [ ] Add place photos display
- [ ] Add business hours, contact info, ratings
- [ ] Test place details functionality

### 6.4 Apply Existing Styling
- [ ] Ensure all new components use existing `ColorStyle.swift`
- [ ] Apply `FontStyle.swift` to new text elements
- [ ] Use `Spacing.swift` for consistent layout
- [ ] Match existing component styling patterns

## Phase 7: Testing & Optimization

### 7.1 Functionality Testing

- [ ] Test image loading performance
- [ ] Optimize any slow operations

### 7.3 Cost Monitoring
- [ ] Monitor actual API usage and costs
- [ ] Verify usage stays within expected budget
- [ ] Optimize API calls if needed
- [ ] Document final cost per user metrics

## Phase 8: Final Integration & Polish

### 8.1 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test complete user flows end-to-end

## Notes
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Don't skip phases - they depend on each other
- Test thoroughly at each step before moving forward
- Keep the existing app functionality working throughout the process
- Focus on minimalism - only add what's needed
