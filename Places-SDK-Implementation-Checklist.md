## Notes
- Each phase builds on the previous one
- Don't skip phases - they depend on each other
- Test thoroughly at each step before moving forward
- Keep the existing app functionality working throughout the process
- Focus on minimalism - only add what's needed

## Phase 5 Completion Summary ✅
**Successfully completed on:** *December 19, 2024*

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ **Google Places Text Search** - Full implementation using GooglePlacesSwift SDK
- ✅ **Location Management** - Complete location permission and bias handling
- ✅ **Service Architecture** - Clean service layer with proper error handling
- ✅ **Real API Integration** - Live Google Places API calls with proper field masks
- ✅ **UI Integration** - SearchResultsView now uses real Google Places data
- ✅ **Testing Infrastructure** - Sandbox testing environment for verification
- ✅ **Build Verification** - All code compiles and runs without errors

**Technical Implementation:**
- **GooglePlacesService.swift** - `searchByText` with location bias and field limiting
- **LocationManager.swift** - When-In-Use permissions with published state
- **PlacesServiceSandbox.swift** - Comprehensive testing interface
- **SearchResultsView** integration with loading/error states and real results
- **Proper async/await patterns** throughout the codebase

**Lessons Learned:**
- Google SDK API structure requires `Result` handling, not direct return values
- Location bias is required (≤50km) - fallback to default coordinates works well
- Field masking is critical for cost optimization and performance
- Real-time location updates should stop after first successful reading
- SwiftUI `@StateObject` and `@Published` work excellently for reactive search

## Phase 4 Completion Summary ✅
**Successfully completed on:** *[Previous Session]*

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ **Unified Place Models** - Clean, consistent data structure across the app
- ✅ **GooglePlacesSwift Integration** - Modern Swift SDK properly configured  
- ✅ **Clean Architecture** - Removed old conflicting models and mock data
- ✅ **Compilation Success** - All code builds and runs without errors
- ✅ **Foundation Ready** - Solid base for Phase 5 real API implementation

**Lessons Learned:**
- Mock data maintenance becomes technical debt during model migrations
- Placeholder implementations work better than complex mock logic for verification phases
- Phase separation is critical - setup vs implementation should be distinct
- Real API exploration needs to come after structure setup, not before

## Recent SDK Updates (November 2024)
- **Google consolidated both GooglePlaces and GooglePlacesSwift into one repository**
- **Repository URL:** `https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-places-sdk` (contains both SDKs)
- **Key Change:** During package installation, select `GooglePlacesSwift` library instead of `GooglePlaces`
- **Minimum Version:** 9.2.0 or later required for GooglePlacesSwift access
- **Import Statement:** Use `import GooglePlacesSwift` (not `import GooglePlaces`)
- **Initialization:** Use `PlacesClient.shared.initialize(with: apiKey)` (modern Swift API)
