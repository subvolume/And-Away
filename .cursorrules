# Cursor Rules for And Away iOS Project

## User Profile
- User is a UI designer (not a developer) with basic technical understanding
- Simplify language when explaining technical concepts

## Working Style
- **Always explain what you're planning to do BEFORE doing it**
- **Ask for permission before making changes or adding files**
- **Answer questions first, don't just execute immediately**
- **Do ONE thing at a time, keep it very simple**
- **Wait for user to specify the next requirement after each step**
- **Be less aggressive with changes - collaborate, don't assume**
- **If given a straightforward order, it's OK to just make the change requested**
- **Update this .cursorrules file as we discover new preferences**

## Communication Style
- Explain technical concepts in simple terms
- Break down complex tasks into small, manageable steps
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear
- Use analogies or simple explanations for technical concepts

## Code Changes
- Only make the specific change requested
- Don't add extra features or files unless explicitly asked
- Keep implementations simple and focused
- Use clear, descriptive comments in code
