# API & Data Implementation Planning
*And Away iOS Project - API-First Approach*

## 1. API Reality Check

### First: Understand What We Actually Get

Before building anything, we need to explore the real APIs and see what data they actually provide.

**Google Places API - What We Need to Test:**
- Text Search: "coffee shops in Paris" 
- Nearby Search: Places around user location
- Place Details: Full info for a specific place
- Autocomplete: Search suggestions
- Place Photos: Images

**Apple MapKit - What We Need to Test:**
- MKLocalSearch: Text and nearby search
- MKMapItem: Place details 
- CLGeocoder: Address lookup
- What photos/images are available?

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What fields does each API actually return?
- Which data is reliable vs spotty?
- What's missing from each provider?
- How do the data structures differ?
- What are the rate limits and costs?

## 2. API Feature Testing

### What Should Work Out of the Box
- **Real-time autocomplete** - Built into both APIs
- **Location-aware results** - Standard API functionality  
- **Geographic bounds search** - Native API feature
- **Category search** - Should understand "restaurants", "coffee", etc.

### Test What Each API Actually Provides

**Basic API Capabilities:**
- Google Autocomplete API - Does it work in real-time?
- Apple MKLocalSearchCompleter - How responsive is it?
- Google Places Text Search - Location awareness quality?
- Apple MKLocalSearch - Geographic bounds support?

**Standard Test Cases:**
- Search "coffee" near user location
- Search "restaurants" within map bounds
- Autocomplete "Starb..." â†’ "Starbucks"
- Search within specific geographic region

**What We're Evaluating:**
- Which API gives better out-of-the-box results
- Data quality and coverage differences
- Performance and responsiveness
- Which requires less configuration

## 3. Simple Abstraction Approach

### Goal: Easy Provider Switching

**Basic Strategy:**
- Create simple protocols for search and details
- Each provider implements the same interface
- ViewModels only know about the protocols
- One config setting switches providers

**Key Principle:**
Build the abstraction layer AFTER we understand what each API actually provides. Don't guess what the interface should look like.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: API Exploration
- Set up Google Places API access
- Make real API calls and document responses
- Test Apple MapKit search capabilities
- Document what each API actually provides
- Identify strengths/weaknesses of each

### Phase 2: Build from Reality
- Create models based on actual API responses
- Build simple abstraction layer
- Implement one provider first (likely Google)
- Get basic search working in the app

### Phase 3: Add Second Provider
- Implement Apple MapKit version
- Test provider switching
- Compare real-world results
- Adjust abstraction layer based on learnings

### Phase 4: Polish & Features
- Implement smart fallbacks
- Add advanced features as needed
- User testing and refinement

## 5. Questions to Answer Through Testing

**Data Quality:**
- Which API has better international coverage?
- Which provides richer business information?
- Photo availability and quality comparison?
- Search relevance and accuracy?

**Technical Considerations:**
- API response times and reliability?
- Rate limiting and cost implications?
- Offline capability differences?
- Integration complexity?

**User Experience:**
- Which feels more natural for our use case?
- Can we combine strengths of both?
- What provider switching UI makes sense?

## 6. Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete:
- Clear documentation of what each API provides
- Real JSON response examples
- Identified strengths/weaknesses
- Decision on primary vs secondary provider

### Phase 2 Complete:
- Working search with one provider
- Clean abstraction interface defined
- Models that match real API data

### Phase 3 Complete:
- Both providers working
- Easy switching between them
- Real comparison data

## 7. APIs We Need

### Apple APIs
- **MapKit** - Basic search and maps
- **CoreLocation** - User location
- **MKLocalSearchCompleter** - Autocomplete
- **CLGeocoder** - Address conversion
- **MKDirections** - Navigation

### Google APIs
- **Places API** - Search and place details
- **Autocomplete API** - Search suggestions  
- **Geocoding API** - Address conversion
- **Directions API** - Navigation
- **Place Photos API** - Business images
- **Distance Matrix API** - Travel time ranking (optional)

## 8. Next Steps

1. **Set up API access** for Google Places
2. **Test basic searches** and document responses
3. **Compare with Apple MapKit** search results
4. **Build simple models** based on real data
5. **Create minimal abstraction layer**
6. **Get one provider working** in the app

## Notes

- **Keep it simple** - Don't over-engineer the abstraction
- **Test with real data** - Use actual searches you'd make in the app
- **Document everything** - Save real API responses for reference
- **Start small** - Get basic search working before adding complexity
- **User feedback** - Test both providers and see which feels better
