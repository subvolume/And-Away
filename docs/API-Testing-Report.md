# API Testing Report: Google Places vs Apple MapKit
*And Away iOS Project - Comprehensive API Comparison*

## Executive Summary

Through systematic testing of Google Places API and Apple MapKit, we discovered significant differences in search behavior, location intelligence, and user experience implications. **Google Places API emerged as the clear choice for primary search functionality**, particularly for autocomplete and location-aware queries.

## Testing Environment

- **User Location:** Netherlands
- **Google API Configuration:** Hardcoded San Francisco coordinates (37.7749, -122.4194)
- **Apple MapKit Configuration:** Default iOS implementation with device location awareness
- **Testing Tool:** Custom sandbox with search-as-you-type functionality

## Test 1: Partial Query Performance (Autocomplete Testing)

### Test Methodology
Progressive typing simulation to test autocomplete behavior at 1-6 character levels.

### Key Findings

#### Search Term: "Coffee" / "Starbucks"
**Apple MapKit:**
- 1-3 characters: Irrelevant results (Uppsala County, Colorado, Court F)
- 4+ characters: Expected, relevant results (coffee shops)

**Google Places:**
- 1-2 characters: Good, relevant results
- 3 characters: Temporary dip to 2 results
- 4+ characters: Consistent good results

#### Search Term: "Pizza"
**Apple MapKit:**
- Improved performance: Good results starting at 3 characters
- Variable threshold depending on search category

**Google Places:**
- Consistent pattern across all search terms
- Predictable behavior regardless of category

### Conclusion
**Google Places API provides superior and more consistent autocomplete experience**, making it ideal for search-as-you-type functionality.

## Test 2: Location Context Intelligence

### "Near Me" Queries

**Query:** "Restaurants near me"

**Apple MapKit:**
- Results: Dutch/European restaurants (correct for user's actual location)
- Behavior: Uses device location automatically
- User Experience: Intuitive - "near me" means where user actually is

**Google Places:**
- Results: San Francisco restaurants (uses hardcoded API coordinates)
- Behavior: Parameter-driven, ignores device location
- User Experience: Requires explicit location parameters for accuracy

### Explicit Location Queries

**Query:** "Pizza in San Francisco"

**Both APIs:**
- Excellent results for explicitly stated locations
- Apple correctly shows SF pizza despite user being in Netherlands
- Google shows SF pizza using hardcoded coordinates

### Category-Only Queries

**Query:** "Hotels" / "Banks" (no location specified)

**Apple MapKit:**
- Shows San Francisco results (NOT Netherlands where user is located)
- Inconsistent location logic: uses device location for "near me" but mystery default for categories

**Google Places:**
- Consistently shows San Francisco results (predictable hardcoded behavior)
- More consistent behavior across query types

### Location Override Testing

**Query:** "Pizza in New York"

**Both APIs:**
- Successfully override default/device location
- Show NYC pizza places correctly
- Google can override hardcoded SF coordinates when explicit location provided

## Test 3: Brand Recognition

### Test Results

| Brand | Apple Results | Google Results | Quality |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Starbucks | 22 locations | 20 locations | Both excellent |
| McDonald's | 17 locations | 20 locations | Both excellent |
| Whole Foods | 24 locations | 20 locations (more granular) | Google more detailed |

### Key Insights
- **Both APIs:** Excellent brand recognition for major chains
- **Apple:** Simple store-level results
- **Google:** More detailed results (departments, specific location names)
- **Result counts:** Vary by location and actual business density

## Test 4: Landmark Recognition

### Test Results

| Landmark | Apple Results | Google Results | Notes |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Eiffel Tower | 1 result (perfect) | 1 result (perfect) | Global recognition |
| Statue of Liberty | 1 result (perfect) | 1 result (perfect) | Global recognition |
| Big Ben | 3 results | 1 result | Apple: official name + related |
| Rijksmuseum | 1 result (perfect) | 1 result (perfect) | Local landmark |
| Golden Gate Bridge | 1 result (perfect) | 1 result (perfect) | Cross-region landmark |

### Key Insights
- **Both APIs:** Excellent landmark recognition regardless of user location
- **Location context override:** Famous landmarks bypass all location logic
- **Precision:** Users get exactly what they expect
- **Travel app suitability:** Perfect for tourist/landmark searches

---

## Technical Issues Discovered

### 1. Duplicate ID Problem
**Issue:** Google Places API returns multiple locations with identical names, breaking SwiftUI ForEach
**Examples:** Multiple "Starbucks", "Blue Bottle Coffee", "Shell" entries
**Impact:** UI rendering errors and undefined behavior
**Solution Needed:** Compound ID using name + address or place_id

### 2. Apple MapKit Location Inconsistency
**Issue:** Inconsistent location behavior across query types
- "Near me" → Device location
- Categories only → Mystery default region  
- Explicit location → Correctly overrides

### 3. Network Connection Warnings
**Issue:** Various nw_connection warnings in console
**Impact:** Cosmetic - doesn't affect functionality

## API Capability Comparison

| Feature | Apple MapKit | Google Places | Winner |
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| Autocomplete Quality | Variable (3-4 char threshold) | Consistent (1-2 char) | **Google** |
| Location Intelligence | Inconsistent | Predictable | **Google** |
| Brand Recognition | Excellent | Excellent (more detailed) | **Tie/Google** |
| Landmark Search | Excellent | Excellent | **Tie** |
| "Near Me" Queries | Intuitive (device location) | Requires parameters | **Apple** |
| Explicit Location Override | Good | Excellent | **Google** |
| Result Consistency | Variable | Predictable | **Google** |
| Data Richness | Basic | Enhanced (ratings, price, types) | **Google** |

## Strategic Recommendations

### Primary API Selection
**Recommendation: Google Places API as primary search provider**

**Reasons:**
1. **Superior autocomplete experience** - critical for search-as-you-type
2. **Consistent behavior** across all query types
3. **Better location override capabilities**
4. **Richer data** (ratings, price levels, place types)
5. **More predictable** for development and testing

### Secondary API Strategy
**Recommendation: Apple MapKit as backup/fallback**

**Use Cases for Apple MapKit:**
1. **Fallback when Google fails** or reaches quota limits
2. **"Near me" queries** where device location is preferred
3. **Cost optimization** for basic searches
4. **Offline capability** if available

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Build abstraction layer** supporting both providers
2. **Google as primary** for autocomplete and search-as-you-type
3. **Apple as fallback** with graceful degradation
4. **Hybrid approach** possible: Google for autocomplete, Apple for specific use cases

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix duplicate ID issue** in UI (compound IDs)
2. **Complete Step 4** of API Implementation Checklist
3. **Begin building abstraction layer** based on these findings

### API Implementation Priorities
1. **Google Places integration** (primary)
2. **Apple MapKit integration** (secondary)
3. **Provider switching logic**
4. **Error handling and fallbacks**

### Future Testing Needed
1. **Real Google Autocomplete API** (vs Text Search API)
2. **Apple MKLocalSearchCompleter** (vs MKLocalSearch)
3. **Performance benchmarking**
4. **Cost analysis** and quota management

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing revealed that **Google Places API is significantly superior for search-as-you-type functionality** and provides more consistent, predictable behavior across all query types. Apple MapKit excels in specific scenarios (device location awareness) but has inconsistent location logic that could confuse users.

**For And Away's success as a location discovery app, Google Places should be the primary API**, with Apple MapKit serving as a capable backup. The testing methodology proved invaluable in uncovering real-world API behavior that differs significantly from documentation assumptions.
