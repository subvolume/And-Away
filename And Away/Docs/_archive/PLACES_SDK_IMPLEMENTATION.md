## Project: And Away iOS App

### Current State
- [x] SwiftUI app with sophisticated UI architecture
- [x] Complete search flow UI (empty state, results, details)
- [x] MapKit integration with user location
- [x] Sheet management system
- [x] ~~Placeholder content in search/details views~~ **COMPLETED** - Real Google Places data now integrated

---

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: SDK Setup ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add Google Places Swift SDK**
   - Add package dependency: `https://github.com/googlemaps/ios-places-sdk`
   - Select `GooglePlacesSwift` product (version 10.0+)
   - [x] **Verification:** Project builds successfully. `import GooglePlacesSwift` does not cause an error.

- [x] **Configure API Key**
   - Get Google Places API key from Google Cloud Console
   - Add to `And_AwayApp.swift`:
   ```swift
   import GooglePlacesSwift
   
   init() {
       PlacesClient.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
   }
   ```
   - [x] **Verification:** App launches without crashing. No API key-related errors appear in the console.

### Phase 2: Search Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create Places Service Protocol**
   - Centralize all SDK calls in one thin wrapper
   - Easy to stub for testing, update if Google changes API
   ```swift
   protocol PlacesService {
       func searchPlaces(query: String) async -> Result<[Place], PlacesError>
       func fetchPlace(placeID: String) async -> Result<Place, PlacesError>
   }
   ```
   - [x] **Verification:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Places service builds successfully with correct GooglePlacesSwift SDK API usage including proper PlaceProperty enum values (.displayName, .coordinate, .numberOfUserRatings, .websiteURL).

- [x] **Wire Up Search Results**
   - Replace placeholder in `SearchResultsView.swift`
   - Add direct SDK call with required request object:
   ```swift
   let searchRequest = SearchByTextRequest(
       textQuery: query,
       placeProperties: [.name, .placeID, .formattedAddress]
   )
   let places = try await PlacesClient.shared.searchByText(with: searchRequest)
   ```
   - Display results using existing `ListItem` components
   - [x] **Verification:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - SearchResultsView now uses real Google Places data via the PlacesService, displays results with ListItem.searchResult template, includes loading states and error handling.

- [x] **Connect Place Selection**
   - Pass only `placeID` strings between views (lightweight, Codable)
   - Fresh data fetch in details view ensures up-to-date information
   - Simplifies navigation state and persistence
   - [x] **Verification:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Navigation flow working correctly: search results pass place IDs to details view via existing sheet management system.

### Phase 3: Place Details ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Implement Place Details View**
   - Replace placeholder in `PlaceDetailsView.swift`
   - Fetch place details with required request object:
   ```swift
   let detailsRequest = FetchPlaceRequest(
       placeID: placeID,
       placeProperties: [.name, .formattedAddress, .rating, .photos]
   )
   let place = try await PlacesClient.shared.fetchPlace(with: detailsRequest)
   ```
   - Display place info, photos, ratings directly from SDK types
   - [x] **Verification:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - PlaceDetailsView now fetches and displays real place data including name, address, rating, phone, website, and coordinates with proper loading/error states. Swift SDK compatibility issues resolved (numberOfUserRatings and location are non-optional properties).

### Phase 4: Map Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Create Map Marker Component**
    - Create new view where the marker is a 22x22 circular background containing a sf symbol icon.
- [x] **Add Places to Map** - Basic map integration complete, ready for future enhancements

### Phase 5: Polish ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Add Loading States & Error Handling**
   - Simple `do/catch` blocks for SDK calls
   - Loading indicators during searches
   - Basic error messaging
   - [x] **Verification:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Loading indicators visible during searches, error messages appear for network failures, comprehensive error handling implemented.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

### Successfully Delivered:
1. **Full Google Places SDK Integration** - Native Swift SDK properly configured
2. **Real Search Functionality** - Live place search with location bias
3. **Detailed Place Information** - Complete place details with ratings, photos, contact info
4. **Robust Error Handling** - Loading states and error messaging throughout
5. **Clean Architecture** - Service layer pattern for maintainable SDK integration

### Key Realizations
- **No custom data models needed** → Use SDK `Place` types directly ✅
- **Thin service protocol only** → One file to isolate SDK calls for API updates/testing ✅
- **No caching needed** → SDK handles caching internally ✅
- **No complex error mapping** → SDK provides proper Swift errors ✅

---

## Notes
- Modern Swift SDK eliminates most complexity ✅
- Existing UI architecture is perfect for direct SDK integration ✅
- Focus on replacing placeholders, not building infrastructure ✅

**ARCHIVED: This implementation plan is now complete. All core Google Places functionality has been successfully integrated into the And Away iOS app.**
