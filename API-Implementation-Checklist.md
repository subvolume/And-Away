## Phase 3: Google Places Integration

### Step 6: Core Search Service
- [ ] Create GooglePlacesService class
- [ ] Implement text search functionality
- [ ] Implement autocomplete functionality
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Add request cancellation support

**Checkpoint 6:** âœ… Core search functionality works
- [ ] Text search returns reliable results
- [ ] Autocomplete provides real-time suggestions
- [ ] Errors handled gracefully
- [ ] No memory leaks or hanging requests

### Step 7: Enhanced Features
- [ ] Implement place details fetching
- [ ] Implement nearby search
- [ ] Add place photos support
- [ ] Add user location integration
- [ ] Implement result caching

**Checkpoint 7:** âœ… Full-featured search service
- [ ] All Google Places endpoints working
- [ ] Rich place details available
- [ ] Photos loading correctly
- [ ] Performance optimized with caching

## Phase 4: App Integration

### Step 8: Replace Mock Data
- [ ] Update search views to use GooglePlacesService
- [ ] Replace temporary models with production models
- [ ] Add loading states for search
- [ ] Add error states and retry logic
- [ ] Test with real user interactions

**Checkpoint 8:** âœ… App works with Google Places API
- [ ] Search works as expected in app
- [ ] Loading states work properly
- [ ] Error handling is user-friendly
- [ ] Real data displays correctly

### Step 9: Performance & Polish
- [ ] Add request debouncing for autocomplete
- [ ] Optimize API call frequency
- [ ] Add proper cancellation for old requests
- [ ] Test with poor network conditions
- [ ] Add analytics/logging for API usage
- [ ] Fix duplicate ID issues in UI

**Checkpoint 9:** âœ… Production-ready implementation
- [ ] App performs well under normal conditions
- [ ] App handles poor network gracefully
- [ ] API usage is optimized (not wasting calls)
- [ ] Can monitor API usage and costs
- [ ] UI works flawlessly with real data

## Phase 5: Enhanced Features

### Step 10: Category-Based Search Implementation
- [ ] Research Google Places API type filtering
- [ ] Design two-step search flow: partial input â†’ categories â†’ places
- [ ] Test category recognition from partial input ("co" â†’ "Coffee")
- [ ] Implement category selection UI
- [ ] Test category-filtered place search
- [ ] Optimize category search performance

**Checkpoint 10:** âœ… Category search enhances discovery experience
- [ ] Users can find categories from partial input
- [ ] Category tap shows relevant places
- [ ] Google Places types cover all needed categories
- [ ] Category search feels intuitive and fast

## Phase 6: Final Testing & Launch

### Step 11: User Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Test with real users doing real searches
- [ ] Monitor Google API usage and costs
- [ ] Identify any remaining issues
- [ ] Optimize based on real usage patterns
- [ ] Add offline error handling

**Checkpoint 11:** âœ… Ready for production launch
- [ ] Users can find what they're looking for
- [ ] Search feels fast and responsive
- [ ] API costs are within budget
- [ ] No major usability issues
- [ ] App handles all edge cases

## Cost Management

**Google API Cost Monitoring:**
- [ ] Set up billing alerts in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Monitor daily/monthly usage
- [ ] Implement usage analytics in app
- [ ] Have cost optimization strategies ready

**Performance Optimization:**
- [ ] Request caching where Terms of Service allow
- [ ] Debouncing to reduce API calls
- [ ] Request cancellation for efficiency
- [ ] Minimize unnecessary detail requests

## Phase 7: Cleanup & Finalization

### Step 12: Code Cleanup
- [ ] Delete the temporary Google model files (GoogleAutocompleteModels.swift, etc.)
- [ ] Remove SandboxView.swift testing environment
- [ ] Clean up any remaining test/debug code
- [ ] Update MockData.swift to use production models (if still needed)
- [ ] Final code review and documentation

**Checkpoint 12:** âœ… Clean production codebase
- [ ] No temporary or duplicate model files
- [ ] All views use production GooglePlacesService
- [ ] No debug/testing code in production
- [ ] Code is clean and maintainable

**Note:** *The current Google model files were restored temporarily to keep the app working while implementing the API-first approach. They should be removed once the real implementation is complete.*
