# API Implementation Checklist
*And Away iOS Project - Step-by-Step Implementation*

## Phase 1: API Exploration & Setup

### Step 1: Google Places API Setup
- [ ] Create Google Cloud Platform account
- [ ] Enable Places API in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Generate API key and restrict it properly
- [ ] Set up billing account
- [ ] Test API key with a simple curl request

**Checkpoint 1:** ✅ Confirm API key works and returns real data
- [ ] Can make successful API calls
- [ ] API key restrictions are working
- [ ] Billing is set up correctly

### Step 2: Apple MapKit Setup
- [ ] Verify iOS development environment is ready
- [ ] Add MapKit framework to project
- [ ] Add location permissions to Info.plist
- [ ] Test basic MKLocalSearch in simulator

**Checkpoint 2:** ✅ Confirm Apple APIs work in your project
- [ ] MapKit imports successfully
- [ ] Location permissions request properly
- [ ] Basic search returns results

### Step 3: Create Sandbox Environment
- [ ] Add a debug "API Test" tab or view to existing app
- [ ] Create simple UI with search field and result display
- [ ] Add buttons to test Google vs Apple APIs
- [ ] Add text view to show raw API responses
- [ ] Set up so it can be easily removed later

**Checkpoint 3:** ✅ Sandbox environment ready for testing
- [ ] Can input search terms
- [ ] Can display API responses
- [ ] Easy to test both providers side-by-side
- [ ] Doesn't interfere with main app functionality

### Step 4: API Response Documentation
- [ ] Test Google Places Text Search with real queries
- [ ] Test Google Places Nearby Search
- [ ] Test Google Autocomplete API
- [ ] Test Apple MKLocalSearch with same queries
- [ ] Test Apple MKLocalSearchCompleter
- [ ] Document actual JSON responses for each

**Checkpoint 4:** ✅ Have real API response examples saved
- [ ] Google API responses documented
- [ ] Apple API responses documented
- [ ] Can see the data structure differences
- [ ] Identified what data each API provides/lacks

## Phase 2: Data Comparison & Analysis

### Step 5: Side-by-Side API Testing
- [ ] Search "coffee shops in [your city]" on both APIs
- [ ] Search "restaurants near [coordinates]" on both APIs
- [ ] Test autocomplete with "Starb..." on both APIs
- [ ] Compare result quality and accuracy
- [ ] Document strengths/weaknesses of each

**Checkpoint 5:** ✅ Clear understanding of API differences
- [ ] Know which API gives better results for different searches
- [ ] Understand cost implications of each
- [ ] Decided on primary vs backup provider approach

### Step 6: Create Real Data Models
- [ ] Create models based on actual API responses (not guessed)
- [ ] Design common interface that both APIs can fit into
- [ ] Account for missing fields in each API
- [ ] Handle different data types and structures

**Checkpoint 6:** ✅ Models match reality
- [ ] Models can handle real Google API responses
- [ ] Models can handle real Apple API responses
- [ ] Common interface makes sense for both
- [ ] No fields that don't actually exist in APIs

## Phase 3: Build Abstraction Layer

### Step 7: Create Protocol/Interface
- [ ] Define search protocol that both providers implement
- [ ] Define place detail protocol
- [ ] Define autocomplete protocol
- [ ] Keep it simple - only what both APIs can actually do

**Checkpoint 7:** ✅ Clean abstraction interface
- [ ] Protocol is simple and focused
- [ ] Both providers can implement it
- [ ] No leaky abstractions
- [ ] Easy to add new providers later

### Step 8: Implement First Provider
- [ ] Choose primary provider (Google or Apple)
- [ ] Implement all protocol methods
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Add basic caching if allowed
- [ ] Test thoroughly

**Checkpoint 8:** ✅ First provider works completely
- [ ] All search types work
- [ ] Error handling works
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Can use in actual app views

## Phase 4: Add Second Provider

### Step 9: Implement Second Provider
- [ ] Implement same protocols for other provider
- [ ] Handle differences in data structure
- [ ] Add provider-specific error handling
- [ ] Test thoroughly

**Checkpoint 9:** ✅ Second provider works completely
- [ ] All search types work with second provider
- [ ] Abstraction layer handles both providers seamlessly
- [ ] No crashes when switching providers
- [ ] Results are comparable

### Step 10: Provider Switching Logic
- [ ] Add configuration to switch providers
- [ ] Add fallback logic (if primary fails, try secondary)
- [ ] Add user preference option (optional)
- [ ] Test switching between providers

**Checkpoint 10:** ✅ Provider switching works smoothly
- [ ] Can switch providers without app restart
- [ ] Fallback works when primary provider fails
- [ ] No memory leaks when switching
- [ ] User doesn't notice the switch

## Phase 5: Integration & Testing

### Step 11: Integrate with App Views
- [ ] Replace mock data with real API calls
- [ ] Update search views to use abstraction layer
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add error states
- [ ] Test with real user interactions

**Checkpoint 11:** ✅ App works with real APIs
- [ ] Search works as expected in app
- [ ] Loading states work properly
- [ ] Error handling is user-friendly
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for users

### Step 12: Performance & Polish
- [ ] Add request debouncing for autocomplete
- [ ] Optimize API call frequency
- [ ] Add proper cancellation for old requests
- [ ] Test with poor network conditions
- [ ] Add analytics/logging for API usage

**Checkpoint 12:** ✅ Production-ready implementation
- [ ] App performs well under normal conditions
- [ ] App handles poor network gracefully
- [ ] API usage is optimized (not wasting calls)
- [ ] Can monitor API usage and costs

## Phase 6: Final Validation

### Step 13: User Testing
- [ ] Test with real users doing real searches
- [ ] Compare user satisfaction with different providers
- [ ] Identify any remaining issues
- [ ] Gather feedback on search quality

**Checkpoint 13:** ✅ Users are satisfied with search experience
- [ ] Users can find what they're looking for
- [ ] Search feels fast and responsive
- [ ] No major usability issues
- [ ] Ready for app release

## Emergency Checkpoints

**If Google API costs too much:**
- [ ] Can immediately switch to Apple MapKit
- [ ] App still functions with reduced features
- [ ] Users can still search for places

**If Apple MapKit results are poor:**
- [ ] Can switch to Google as primary
- [ ] Cost implications are understood and acceptable
- [ ] App performance is still good

**If both APIs have issues:**
- [ ] Have identified specific limitations
- [ ] Have workarounds for critical features
- [ ] Know what functionality to delay/remove

## Final Success Criteria

✅ **App can search for places reliably**  
✅ **Users can find coffee shops, restaurants, etc.**  
✅ **Autocomplete works as users type**  
✅ **App works with poor network conditions**  
✅ **API costs are predictable and manageable**  
✅ **Can switch providers if needed**  
✅ **Code is maintainable and well-tested**
