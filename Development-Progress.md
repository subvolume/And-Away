# And Away Development Progress

## Current Focus
üéØ **Phase 1 Complete - Ready for Phase 2** - Dual Provider Integration (Apple MapKit + Google Places)

## Development Steps

### ‚úÖ Planning Phase
- [x] Read through API-Data-Planning.md
- [x] Decided on step-by-step approach
- [x] Created this progress tracking file

### üîÑ Phase 1: Foundation Architecture

#### Step 1: Create Basic Structure ‚úÖ 
**Goal**: Set up the foundation files and folder structure
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] Created `Protocols/` folder for service contracts
- [x] Created `PlacesServiceProtocols.swift` with basic protocol definitions
- [x] Verified project structure and compilation
- [x] Set up foundation for provider-agnostic architecture

**Result**: New protocols file exists and compiles successfully with the project

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Data Models ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Create the `Place` and `PlaceCategory` structs
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `Place.swift` - Core place data structure with provider-agnostic design
- [x] `SearchResult.swift` - Search result wrapper with scoring and context
- [x] Supporting models: `OpenStatus`, `PlaceImageInfo`, `SearchMatchType`
- [x] Fixed naming conflicts with existing Google models
- [x] Added CLLocation compatibility while maintaining Codable conformance

**Result**: We have working Swift structs that hold place information and compile successfully

---

#### Step 3: Create Mock Data ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Make sample places for testing
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `MockPlacesData.swift` - Comprehensive sample data service  
- [x] 6 category types (restaurants, coffee, parks, museums, shopping, hotels)
- [x] 9 realistic sample places in San Francisco area
- [x] Mock search functionality with organized results
- [x] Convenience methods for filtering and searching
- [x] Sample photos and complete place information

**Result**: We have a rich dataset for testing all our foundation models and search functionality

---

#### Step 4: Build First Protocol ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Create the `PlacesSearchService` protocol
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `PlacesServiceProtocols.swift` - Complete protocol definitions
- [x] `PlacesSearchService` - Search methods with clear signatures
- [x] `PlaceDetailsService` - Place detail retrieval methods
- [x] `AutocompleteService` - Autocomplete functionality
- [x] `DirectionsService` - Routing and directions
- [x] `LocationService` - Location permissions and access
- [x] Supporting types: `AutocompleteSuggestion`, `TransportMode`, `ProtocolRouteInfo`

**Result**: We have comprehensive protocols that any service provider can implement

---

#### Step 5: Create Mock Service ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Build a fake search service using sample data
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `MockPlacesService.swift` - Implements the `PlacesSearchService` protocol
- [x] Smart search logic with exact, partial, and category matching
- [x] Distance-based filtering and relevance scoring
- [x] Realistic network delays and proper result organization
- [x] All three protocol methods: `searchPlaces()`, `nearbyPlaces()`, `searchByName()`
- [x] Keyword mapping for category searches (coffee ‚Üí coffee shops, etc.)

**Result**: Search for "coffee" returns Blue Bottle Coffee and Philz Coffee with proper match types and relevance scores

---

#### Step 6: Test in Simple View ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Connect mock service to basic UI
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we accomplished**:
- [x] Connected MockPlacesService to existing SearchResultsView
- [x] Implemented async search with proper state management
- [x] Added loading indicators and error handling
- [x] Fixed critical bug: partialNameMatch results weren't being organized properly
- [x] Added task cancellation to prevent race conditions
- [x] Thoroughly tested and debugged the complete search pipeline
- [x] Cleaned up all debug logging for production-ready code

**Result**: Search is fully functional! Type "coffee" ‚Üí see coffee shops, "blue" ‚Üí see Blue Bottle Coffee, "bak" ‚Üí see Tartine Bakery

---

#### Step 7: Clean Up Category Management ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Implement centralized CategoryRegistry system
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `CategoryRegistry.swift` - Centralized category definitions with colors, icons, keywords
- [x] Moved category colors from SearchResultsView to CategoryRegistry
- [x] Implemented provider-agnostic category mapping system
- [x] Added support for unknown/fallback categories with proper color defaults
- [x] Updated MockPlacesService and SearchResultsView to use CategoryRegistry
- [x] Created comprehensive SwiftUI preview using ListItem component
- [x] Eliminated scattered category logic across multiple files

**Result**: All category management is now centralized in one location, making it easy to add new categories and maintain consistency across the app

## Next Phases

### üéØ Phase 2: Dual Provider Integration (Current Priority)
**Goal**: Build both Apple MapKit and Google Places services in parallel

**Track A: Apple MapKit Service (Fast Track)** üçé
- [x] Step A1: Create AppleMapKitService Shell ‚úÖ
- [ ] Step A2: Implement Apple Text Search (MKLocalSearch)
- [ ] Step A3: Implement Apple Nearby Search

**Track B: Google Places Service (Rich Data)** üåç  
- [ ] Step B1: Google Setup & Research (API keys, pricing)
- [ ] Step B2: Create GooglePlacesService Shell
- [ ] Step B3: Implement Google Text Search
- [ ] Step B4: Implement Google Nearby Search

**Track C: Integration & Comparison** ‚öñÔ∏è
- [ ] Step C1: Provider Switching System (Mock/Apple/Google toggle)
- [ ] Step C2: Side-by-Side Comparison View
- [ ] Step C3: Provider Analytics & Performance Metrics

### üîÆ Future Phases
- **Phase 3**: Search Intelligence & Scoring Optimization
- **Phase 4**: Storage & Bookmarks (iCloud integration)
- **Phase 5**: UI Polish & Advanced Features

## Notes & Decisions
- Keeping each step small and focused
- Building foundation before adding complexity
- Using mock data to test everything first

## Phase 1 Architecture Review ‚úÖ

### ‚úÖ **FOUNDATION COMPLETE** - Excellent Implementation
**All architectural pieces in place for provider switching:**

1. **Protocol-Based Abstraction** ‚úÖ
   - `PlacesServiceProtocols.swift` - 5 service protocols fully defined
   - Clean contracts that any provider (Google, Apple, etc.) can implement

2. **Provider-Agnostic Data Models** ‚úÖ  
   - `Place.swift` - Universal place structure with all needed fields
   - `SearchResult.swift` - Smart search results with scoring and match types
   - Supporting models: `OpenStatus`, `PlaceImageInfo`, `SearchContext`

3. **Centralized Category Management** ‚úÖ
   - `CategoryRegistry.swift` - 6 categories with colors, icons, keywords  
   - Provider mapping system ready for Google/Apple integration
   - Search keyword matching ("coffee" ‚Üí coffee shops)

4. **Working Mock Implementation** ‚úÖ
   - `MockPlacesService.swift` - Fully implements search protocols
   - `MockPlacesData.swift` - 9 realistic SF places with rich data
   - Smart search logic with relevance scoring

5. **UI Integration** ‚úÖ
   - `SearchResultsView.swift` - Connected to mock service
   - Async search with loading states and error handling
   - Works with existing `ListItem` components

### üéØ **Ready for Phase 2**: Easy Provider Switching
```swift
// Current: Mock service
let searchService: PlacesSearchService = MockPlacesService()

// Future: Just change one line!
let searchService: PlacesSearchService = AppleMapKitService()
let searchService: PlacesSearchService = GooglePlacesService()
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Technical Debt Resolved**
- ‚úÖ Category management centralized in CategoryRegistry
- ‚úÖ Color constants properly organized  
- ‚úÖ Search result organization working correctly

## Phase 2 Decision Points
- **Apple vs Google first?** Both in parallel is recommended
- **Google API costs?** Need to research pricing and quotas
- **Provider switching UI?** Simple debug toggle or user-facing setting?
