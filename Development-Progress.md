# And Away Development Progress

## Current Focus
üéØ **Getting Started** - Setting up the foundation

## Development Steps

### ‚úÖ Planning Phase
- [x] Read through API-Data-Planning.md
- [x] Decided on step-by-step approach
- [x] Created this progress tracking file

### üîÑ Phase 1: Foundation Architecture

#### Step 1: Create Basic Structure ‚úÖ 
**Goal**: Set up the foundation files and folder structure
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] Created `Protocols/` folder for service contracts
- [x] Created `PlacesServiceProtocols.swift` with basic protocol definitions
- [x] Verified project structure and compilation
- [x] Set up foundation for provider-agnostic architecture

**Result**: New protocols file exists and compiles successfully with the project

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Data Models ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Create the `Place` and `PlaceCategory` structs
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `Place.swift` - Core place data structure with provider-agnostic design
- [x] `SearchResult.swift` - Search result wrapper with scoring and context
- [x] Supporting models: `OpenStatus`, `PlaceImageInfo`, `SearchMatchType`
- [x] Fixed naming conflicts with existing Google models
- [x] Added CLLocation compatibility while maintaining Codable conformance

**Result**: We have working Swift structs that hold place information and compile successfully

---

#### Step 3: Create Mock Data ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Make sample places for testing
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `MockPlacesData.swift` - Comprehensive sample data service  
- [x] 6 category types (restaurants, coffee, parks, museums, shopping, hotels)
- [x] 9 realistic sample places in San Francisco area
- [x] Mock search functionality with organized results
- [x] Convenience methods for filtering and searching
- [x] Sample photos and complete place information

**Result**: We have a rich dataset for testing all our foundation models and search functionality

#### Step 4: Build First Protocol
**Goal**: Create the `PlacesSearchService` protocol
**Status**: üü° Ready to Start

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] `PlacesSearchService.swift` - Search service contract
- [ ] Define search methods (text search, nearby search)
- [ ] Clear function signatures

**How we'll know it's done**: We have a protocol other services can implement

---

#### Step 5: Create Mock Service
**Goal**: Build a fake search service using sample data
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] `MockPlacesService.swift` - Implements the search protocol
- [ ] Returns mock data based on search queries
- [ ] Basic filtering logic

**How we'll know it's done**: Search for "coffee" returns coffee shops from our mock data

---

#### Step 6: Test in Simple View
**Goal**: Connect mock service to basic UI
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] Simple search interface
- [ ] List view showing results
- [ ] Basic connection between UI and service

**How we'll know it's done**: Type "restaurant" and see restaurants on screen

---

## Next Phases (Future)
- **Phase 2**: Google Places Integration
- **Phase 3**: Search Intelligence & Scoring
- **Phase 4**: Storage & Bookmarks
- **Phase 5**: UI Polish

## Notes & Decisions
- Keeping each step small and focused
- Building foundation before adding complexity
- Using mock data to test everything first

## Questions for Later
- Color scheme preferences
- Icon choices for categories
- UI styling decisions
