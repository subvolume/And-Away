# And Away Development Progress

## Current Focus
üéØ **Getting Started** - Setting up the foundation

## Development Steps

### ‚úÖ Planning Phase
- [x] Read through API-Data-Planning.md
- [x] Decided on step-by-step approach
- [x] Created this progress tracking file

### üîÑ Phase 1: Foundation Architecture

#### Step 1: Create Basic Structure
**Goal**: Set up the foundation files and folder structure
**Status**: üü° Ready to Start

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] Create `Services/` folder for our protocols
- [ ] Create `Models/` folder for data structures  
- [ ] Create `Protocols/` folder for service contracts
- [ ] Set up basic file organization

**How we'll know it's done**: New folders exist, project compiles without errors

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Data Models
**Goal**: Create the `Place` and `PlaceCategory` structs
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] `Place.swift` - Core place data structure
- [ ] `PlaceCategory.swift` - Category definitions
- [ ] `SearchResult.swift` - Search result wrapper

**How we'll know it's done**: We have working Swift structs that hold place information

---

#### Step 3: Create Mock Data
**Goal**: Make sample places for testing
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] `MockData.swift` - Sample restaurants, hotels, coffee shops
- [ ] At least 10-15 varied examples
- [ ] Different categories and locations

**How we'll know it's done**: We can print out a list of sample places

---

#### Step 4: Build First Protocol
**Goal**: Create the `PlacesSearchService` protocol
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] `PlacesSearchService.swift` - Search service contract
- [ ] Define search methods (text search, nearby search)
- [ ] Clear function signatures

**How we'll know it's done**: We have a protocol other services can implement

---

#### Step 5: Create Mock Service
**Goal**: Build a fake search service using sample data
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] `MockPlacesService.swift` - Implements the search protocol
- [ ] Returns mock data based on search queries
- [ ] Basic filtering logic

**How we'll know it's done**: Search for "coffee" returns coffee shops from our mock data

---

#### Step 6: Test in Simple View
**Goal**: Connect mock service to basic UI
**Status**: ‚è≥ Waiting

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] Simple search interface
- [ ] List view showing results
- [ ] Basic connection between UI and service

**How we'll know it's done**: Type "restaurant" and see restaurants on screen

---

## Next Phases (Future)
- **Phase 2**: Google Places Integration
- **Phase 3**: Search Intelligence & Scoring
- **Phase 4**: Storage & Bookmarks
- **Phase 5**: UI Polish

## Notes & Decisions
- Keeping each step small and focused
- Building foundation before adding complexity
- Using mock data to test everything first

## Questions for Later
- Color scheme preferences
- Icon choices for categories
- UI styling decisions
