# And Away Development Progress

## Current Focus
ðŸŽ¯ **Getting Started** - Setting up the foundation

## Development Steps

### âœ… Planning Phase
- [x] Read through API-Data-Planning.md
- [x] Decided on step-by-step approach
- [x] Created this progress tracking file

### ðŸ”„ Phase 1: Foundation Architecture

#### Step 1: Create Basic Structure âœ… 
**Goal**: Set up the foundation files and folder structure
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] Created `Protocols/` folder for service contracts
- [x] Created `PlacesServiceProtocols.swift` with basic protocol definitions
- [x] Verified project structure and compilation
- [x] Set up foundation for provider-agnostic architecture

**Result**: New protocols file exists and compiles successfully with the project

---

#### Step 2: Define Core Data Models âœ…
**Goal**: Create the `Place` and `PlaceCategory` structs
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `Place.swift` - Core place data structure with provider-agnostic design
- [x] `SearchResult.swift` - Search result wrapper with scoring and context
- [x] Supporting models: `OpenStatus`, `PlaceImageInfo`, `SearchMatchType`
- [x] Fixed naming conflicts with existing Google models
- [x] Added CLLocation compatibility while maintaining Codable conformance

**Result**: We have working Swift structs that hold place information and compile successfully

---

#### Step 3: Create Mock Data âœ…
**Goal**: Make sample places for testing
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `MockPlacesData.swift` - Comprehensive sample data service  
- [x] 6 category types (restaurants, coffee, parks, museums, shopping, hotels)
- [x] 9 realistic sample places in San Francisco area
- [x] Mock search functionality with organized results
- [x] Convenience methods for filtering and searching
- [x] Sample photos and complete place information

**Result**: We have a rich dataset for testing all our foundation models and search functionality

---

#### Step 4: Build First Protocol âœ…
**Goal**: Create the `PlacesSearchService` protocol
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `PlacesServiceProtocols.swift` - Complete protocol definitions
- [x] `PlacesSearchService` - Search methods with clear signatures
- [x] `PlaceDetailsService` - Place detail retrieval methods
- [x] `AutocompleteService` - Autocomplete functionality
- [x] `DirectionsService` - Routing and directions
- [x] `LocationService` - Location permissions and access
- [x] Supporting types: `AutocompleteSuggestion`, `TransportMode`, `ProtocolRouteInfo`

**Result**: We have comprehensive protocols that any service provider can implement

---

#### Step 5: Create Mock Service âœ…
**Goal**: Build a fake search service using sample data
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**What we created**:
- [x] `MockPlacesService.swift` - Implements the `PlacesSearchService` protocol
- [x] Smart search logic with exact, partial, and category matching
- [x] Distance-based filtering and relevance scoring
- [x] Realistic network delays and proper result organization
- [x] All three protocol methods: `searchPlaces()`, `nearbyPlaces()`, `searchByName()`
- [x] Keyword mapping for category searches (coffee â†’ coffee shops, etc.)

**Result**: Search for "coffee" returns Blue Bottle Coffee and Philz Coffee with proper match types and relevance scores

---

#### Step 6: Test in Simple View âœ…
**Goal**: Connect mock service to basic UI
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**What we accomplished**:
- [x] Connected MockPlacesService to existing SearchResultsView
- [x] Implemented async search with proper state management
- [x] Added loading indicators and error handling
- [x] Fixed critical bug: partialNameMatch results weren't being organized properly
- [x] Added task cancellation to prevent race conditions
- [x] Thoroughly tested and debugged the complete search pipeline
- [x] Cleaned up all debug logging for production-ready code

**Result**: Search is fully functional! Type "coffee" â†’ see coffee shops, "blue" â†’ see Blue Bottle Coffee, "bak" â†’ see Tartine Bakery

---

#### Step 7: Clean Up Category Management
**Goal**: Implement centralized CategoryRegistry system
**Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Ready to Start

**What we'll create**:
- [ ] `CategoryRegistry.swift` - Centralized category definitions
- [ ] Move category colors from SearchResultsView to registry
- [ ] Implement provider-agnostic category mapping
- [ ] Support for unknown/fallback categories

**Why we need this**: Currently category colors and definitions are scattered across multiple files. Our API planning calls for a centralized CategoryRegistry system.

**How we'll know it's done**: All category logic lives in one place, easy to add new categories

---

## Next Phases (Future)
- **Phase 2**: Google Places Integration
- **Phase 3**: Search Intelligence & Scoring
- **Phase 4**: Storage & Bookmarks
- **Phase 5**: UI Polish

## Notes & Decisions
- Keeping each step small and focused
- Building foundation before adding complexity
- Using mock data to test everything first

## Technical Debt to Address Later
- **Category Management**: Colors and category logic scattered across SearchResultsView and MockPlacesData - should be centralized in CategoryRegistry (Step 7)
- **Color Constants**: Using ColorTokens.swift correctly, but category-to-color mapping is manual

## Questions for Later
- Color scheme preferences
- Icon choices for categories
- UI styling decisions
